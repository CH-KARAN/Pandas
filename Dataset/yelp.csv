It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?

I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break!

Five Star Truck Stop Dining At Its Finest.

Be prepared to eat.  

I was first introduced to the Pine Cone at its Johnson Creek location years ago and freaked out at the size of the awesome, delicious desserts.   Then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one?  I looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery....I knew I was home.

It was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast.  The dinner roll alone is a meal.  I can't say enough about dinner.  Everything is homemade. They don't add alot of salt, if any.  You can tell its fresh.  Its plentiful.  Its cheap.  You literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing.

You can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home.  In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours.  The last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence of bakery goods from the Pine Cone.",0,JwUE5GmEO-sH1FuwJgKBlQ,2,5,29-12-2011,review,5

Father had the typical, two eggs, toast, hash-bowns (seem fresh cut), sausage links.  Food was tasty, no major qualms other than - the hash-browns need a bit more cooking and the coffee needs a bit more bite.

very nice assortment of bakes goods - massive - as large as your head cream-puffs, eclairs - I took a blueberry muffin to go - which I enjoyed.

#NAME?,6wFJ0Ml7r9elqjeoez3HXQ,"Attention fans of David Lynch.  Do stop by this place.  The atmosphere, staff and patrons will certainly help to make your visit enjoyable.
Last time I was here I ordered the caramel nut covered cinnamon roll.  The waitress asked if I wanted it warmed with some butter.   I thought that sounded even better and said to go ahead and do that.  She nodded agreement.  Then when she brought it to me it was unheated and no butter.   Odd but also kind of humorous.  I always enjoy being in a David Lynch film from time to time.
The service and food is way better than the country restaurant just a mile south on 51.  Be sure to go here instead.   Their booths are made for skinny people from the 50s.   take a table.  start a conversations with the truck driver to your left.

The food here is good and the prices are cheap.   Go here for a nice meal and a flash back to the past and don't forget to take home some bakery.  Or if you aren't hungry just stop by for some great baked goods.    Well worth the stop.

I had one of the special Friday offerings, Smelt. It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt. After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders.

I spoke to a representative yesterday to sign up for internet service at my new apartment.  I specifically asked the representative if there were any promotions currently available, in order to receive the best price possible.  He quoted me 39.99 as their only current promotion for basic internet (not including moden/router rentals, upgraded speed, etc.) Taking him at his word, I accepted, and scheduled an installation.  Thus begins the tale of woe:

-------------------------------------------------------------
-  Later that night, on the internet:  I see advertised in giant, bold, colorful letters, $24.99 for basic internet.  Just about half the price of the ""promotion"" the representative offered me.

-  I call the representative line to find out what I was told a blatant lie (in nicer terms, of course).  He confirms the promotion is available, but he doesn't have authority to change me to that price. TRANSFER 1, TO SALES!

- Sales also confirms the much cheaper promotion, but says it is an online-only offer, and she absolutely cannot give it to me:  I can only receive it online, and I will need to reschedule my installation.  TRANSFER 2, TO THE INTERNET!

- The internet promotion finds my address alright, but instead of being able to sign up online, every time I reach the promotion page for my address, I receive the same error message:  ""Your session has timed out or encountered an error. Please start over or click the ""Back Button"" on your browser. If you still wish to contact us.""  This occurs over 3 different computers and the same number of unique browsers.  TRANSFER 3, TO THE ONLINE-CHAT REPRESENTATIVE!

-  Online chat confirms again that the service is available, but I cannot achieve it online, only over the phone.  Having just been told the *exact opposite*, i attempt to point out the circular logic there, but to no avail. Apparently, reducing my price to their own advertised offer would be considered ""downgrading"" a customer, and he is not allowed to do that. TRANSFER 4, TO THE PHONE REPRESENTATIVE (AGAIN)!

-  The new phone representative tells me that as I am NOT a customer, she cannot help me at all.  Still loving the contradictions (the last one claimed that she could not downgrade customers, now I'm not even a customer?  Really?), I try to argue, but she claims sales needs to handle me, and transfers my call.  TRANSFER 5, TO SALES (AGAIN)!

- And at this point, after another few minutes of lovely Charter advertisements and soothingly torturous elevator music, I am transferred to... a voice mail.  This proceeds to Inform me that the Sales Depts. hours are over, so please call back later, and then terminates the call.

awmiM7bsZZLv_WgiTXgRbw,3Pm1t9yeuGctjRPKxNrAOA,"Used Charter for a couple of years. Just ditched them and I couldn't be happier. Shortly after we first started with Charter our connection went out, took them days to send someone out and it turned out they'd disconnected us for no reason at all. Thanks Charter. Fast forward to the recent past when our bill went up, I called up to try and get a new promotional rate because I'm no paying $60 for internet that bombs out briefly a couple times a day. They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. 
After that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website?
Finally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again. After calling to disconnect I got several calls from Charter trying to get my business back if perhaps they offered me a really good rate but by that point they'd managed to blow whatever shred of credibility they had left in my mind. Since I don't trust their billing practices I had no interest in continuing business with them any longer and am now much happier for it!",0,oLctHIA1AxmsgOuu4dM6Vw,0,1,16-08-2010,review,2

I canceled my account towards the middle of June. The account was to be canceled as of 7/1. 

On 7/2, I moved. 

On 7/8, I returned all my equipment to Charter. 

7/9 - present, I am STILL receiving bills for this account (now up to $280!). I have called 4 times and received INCREDIBLY poor service. People who were supposed to call me back have not. All have admitted that, yes, my account is showing up as canceled on 7/1, but that some mysterious ""work order"" has not been completed. The current agent I am speaking with told me they actually OWE me $19, but that the account still will not be canceled until the ""work order"" is complete.

uSlKnryLlnD3mvmG6DIyCg,1ga5Aj9_iNDvc_6K3ol2jA,"The Green Lantern is the kind of place that comes in right above the Mendoza Line.  What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.

My friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.

The negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  

If it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.

Breakfast foods are simple foods.  Many places take advantage of the simplicity by rushing things along.  You end up with edible but uninspired eats.  Though my breakfast arrived shortly after it was ordered, it was cooked properly and with care.  My sunny side up eggs were perfectly done, the whites well set and the yolks warm but properly runny.  The four (!) large slices of bacon were thick and flavorful.  I ordered the hash-browns crispy, and that's how they came.  Everything on the plate was cooked just right and tasted super good.  I could almost like eating breakfast out, if every place served breakfast like this.

Service was fast and friendly.  Coffee was the usual diner style, weak and plentiful.  The bar looked capable of producing a solid bloody mary, but alas this went untested.

_ohPF8fo5ifWiMOrEPrC8Q,Yxcmpokaw5pJjJGMTqgCfg,"The man and I are on this thing now where we are trying to eat at a few places famous for their fish fry's thanks to an article in Madison Magazine.  There are a few places in the mag that I am looking forward to trying but Green Lantern was the first one that we hit up.  

Driving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what I was expecting and not looking forward to.  As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside.  It's huge!   At least it felt huge from where we were sitting.  I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane.  I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table.  On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain.

Because we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this.  We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits.  I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'!  Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it.  

I ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod.  The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns.  The fish was pretty good.  It was juicy and fresh and not bad.  I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was.  With that said however I though it was alright.  The man on the other hand was in love.  He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room.  Pure blasphemy.  He clearly doesn't know anything about food. 

All in all I am glad I tried this place but I don't think I will be making it a regular haunt.",0,rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA,1,3,09-03-2013,review,1
cBBarVpwP94MsS63W4KKZg,LF8brFVyF0tFSrgo16JK2Q,"Stopped in for a dinner after getting a recommendation from a co worker and we were VERY impressed!  It was fairly quiet on a Thursday night - no problem getting a table.  The location is fabulous being right on the lake with views.  The ambiance is very much a north-woods tavern restaurant type establishment - older decor, a little kitschy, though it suits the place, well.

Green Lantern has a reputation of being a surf-turf and they do it well!

I had the Ahi-tuna - it was an incredibly delicate piece of fish cooked perfectly.  My wife had a steak which was also prepared very well.  We are DEFINITELY coming back!

The server, while young and a bit 'nervous', did a fine job and she was very pleasant.  She also provided great suggestions for food pairings!  Well done :)

Hint:  Ask for a seat by the window to get a view of the lake.
hint hint:  The location, ambiance, and setup is VERY family and kid friendly!  They were hosting a birthday party for a grandmother while we were there and the staff bent-over backwards for the family and party - including setting up a powerpoint projector for family slide show and music!

BY9Eyuam4yTP4J2G0jHIyg,WtKlKTqAjM1IlF0hyXgfcQ,"Went last Friday to try the famous fish fry.  Arrived at 5:50pm and was quoted a 25-30 minute wait, which I found acceptable.  We were not called until 55 minutes later, and this only happened when I brought my two young sons and sat on the floor conspicuously in plain view of the host stand.  At that point we were offered the ""quick alternative"" of a table downstairs.  Where was this option earlier?

Look, we knew going out on the first Friday of lent would result in a wait and we brought a myriad of distractions along to kill time for our 4 and 2 year olds.  Those wear thin, however, when the wait is double what you are initially told and have subsequently relayed to the kids.  Maybe this is all due to an inexperienced host.

Our server was very attentive and the food was good.  We tried the baked, beer-battered, and fried fish.  We also had baked potatoes and french fries as well as salads.  Overall, this was not the best Madison has to offer.

I had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar.The bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed I was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail.A few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all.We were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake.So far so good.We ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner.The kalamari came first and it was ok. Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service.",0,rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA,0,2,23-06-2014,review,1

idQx85xfiIm_SGTnDsaXcQ,XQ8-CgwKZ6_dUnEiqbC-bw,"What could I possibly say about the Beach House Restaurant and Lounge?  I guess I could think of a few things.

I went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?

To begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  

Do not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.

The AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).

So give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce.",2,_wZTYYL7cutanzAnJUTGMA,2,5,01-02-2009,review,4
